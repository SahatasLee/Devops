# Zpool

In the context of storage systems like ZFS, a "pool" refers to a collection of physical disks that are grouped together to provide storage space for data. Each pool can consist of one or more physical disks, and data stored in a pool is automatically distributed across the disks for redundancy and performance.

In Kubernetes, when you create persistent volumes using a StorageClass with the OpenEBS CSI driver for ZFS, you often need to specify a "poolname" parameter. This parameter refers to the name of the ZFS storage pool where the data for the persistent volume will be allocated.

Here's how it works:

1. **Create a ZFS Pool**: Before you can use the "poolname" parameter in a StorageClass, you need to create a ZFS pool using the `zpool create` command. For example:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool create zfspv-pool /dev/sdb
   ```

   This command creates a ZFS pool named "zfspv-pool" using the `/dev/sdb` disk.

2. **Specify the Pool in StorageClass**: When defining a StorageClass in Kubernetes, you use the "poolname" parameter to indicate which ZFS storage pool should be used to allocate storage for the persistent volumes created from this StorageClass.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
     name: openebs-zfspv
   parameters:
     fstype: "ext4"
     poolname: "zfspv-pool"  # Specify the ZFS pool name here
   provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
   ```

   In this example, the "poolname" parameter is set to "zfspv-pool", which indicates that the persistent volumes created from this StorageClass will be allocated in the "zfspv-pool" ZFS pool.

Remember that the actual pool name you use should match the pool you created earlier using the `zpool create` command. The pool name is how Kubernetes and the storage system identify where to allocate the storage for your volumes.
